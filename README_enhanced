DeepFrag has been enhanced, additional functionality was added. It is possible to reconstruct entire ligands from fragments predicted by DeepFrag.

New scripts:
- search.py
- tan_simi.py
- download.py
- free_test.py
- test.py
- sminatest.py
- sminatest_eval.py
- smina_correlation.py
- sminacor_eval.py
- ligand_reconstruction.py

Scripts will be shortly documented here, there is some further documentation in the scpripts themselves and the thesis may contain helpful information.

search.py:
This is a very short and simple script for sorting lists of pdb-ids according to the partition (TRAIN, VAL, TEST, specified in the paper) of the MOAD-Dataset, unknown pdb-ids will be given back in a seperate list.

tan_simi.py:
This is an algorithm to compare protein sequences for their Tanimoto similarity.

download.py:
Downloads and prepares files from RSCB for further use, input is a list of pdb-ids. It also creates a file with a list of tuples containing protein- and ligand-ids. This is used as input for other scripts.

free_test.py:

ligand_reconstruction.py:
At the moment it uses the model smin4, the most succesful model trained for 50 Epochs on complexes scoring over 400 for binding affinity. This can be changed in the main function. Further arguments could be added to allow to choose that when executing the script.
